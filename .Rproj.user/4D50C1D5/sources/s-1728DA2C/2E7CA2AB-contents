As a recent college graduate, my understanding of Cognitive Psychology is limited to what I've been exposed to in the last couple of years. With that being said, I have gleaned copious research questions from what I've learned as I find cognition to be an increasingly complex field. Why are our memories so unreliable at times? What makes it so we are incredibly adept at attaining language at such a young age? How can we becomes better at discerning what we know versus what we don't know? In this coming semester, I hope to gain a thorough understanding of not only the aforementioned topics, but cognition as it relates and applies to interdisciplinary fields.
